## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> Examples:
> Bug fixes, Features added, Links to Issues, Links to Pull-Requests, Lightning Talks, Bonus Sessions

Last week I worked through the GitHub tutorial mentioned last week to try and learn how to use it prior to submitting the first status update. I made an attempt to submit the first status update; however, I did something wrong and had to wait until the beginning of this week to successfully make the changes. If I understand correctly, I was trying to push to the original rcos-status-update repository and not the one that I was supposed to have forked/cloned and had on my laptop. 
I also began trying to research MongoDB but it really confused me so I instead focused on reading the portion regarding JSON documents which helped me understand what I had been doing when I worked with the TripAdvisor API last year during HackRPI.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> Examples: New Bugs to be fixed, Design choices

Given the difficulty I had trying to submit the first status update, I definitely need to continue familiarizing myself with GitHub and maybe I will refresh my Python abilities while I practice. I hope that I have learned enough during the small group meeting to submit the second status update before Friday and without having to ask for help. I was able to create the .md file using GitBash and therefore, that seems like a promising start. 
After the small group meeting, my focus for this week is to read about REST APIs and learn specifically about flask. It was recommended from other group members that this would be the best use of my time so I can begin to understand what the backend team is responsible for and how I will be contributing to the explorer website API. 
I know that something called Postman was mentioned to me when discussing these APIs and also when talking about flask. I will also research this and see how this could fit into this project. 

Here are some of the sites I will be looking at this week: 
Flask:

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> Examples: Confusion on how to approach a problem, Limited experience with a specific technology

I am beginning to realize just how little I know and will need to find some form of organization to help me understand everything and how it all works together. I know I will need to review python as well as download an appropriate environment for it. I am thinking I will work through a few exercises from the CS1 website to help me review and then use those files as practice for GitHub. 

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.

I should probably devote a notebook or folder to everything that I am learning during my research so that all the information is in one singular location and can easily be referenced once I get started putting the individual pieces together.
